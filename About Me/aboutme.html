                    Hello, Welcome  to my "About Me" page.  My name is Jacob Mifflin, 
                    and I am a 22 year old National Guardsman from Ohio.  I grew a strong
                    passion for technology when I was about 8 years old.  My passion started
                    out with upgrading hardware components on a computer I had at the time.
                    From then, I quickly developed an interest in how everything worked, 
                    and how everything came to be as it is today in the IT world.  As my passion
                    grew for technology, so did my drive to want to be apart of the process of 
                    creating new things in the IT field.  Ultimately it led me to where I am today,
                    writing this out in a code editor to be apart of a webpage that I created.   
                    In my teenage years I branched out a bit to find some other interests/ hobbies
                     of mine to include working on cars and trucks, welding trailers and other things alike.
                    For awhile before this school, I welded for trailer companies such as East MFG. and Mac trailers
                    .  Of course, I realized it wasnt for me and that I needed to get out and pursue my longest passion
                     I've had to date.  In conclusion, I hope you enjoyed reading a bit about me, and thanks for reading.
